Implementation Checkpoint 1:
+ Created rough draft of simulated trading exchange.
  - Double-auction market that processes orders as they are placed.
  - Basic buy / sell methods.
+ Created trader with ZI (zero intelligence) trading strategy.
  - Random trading strategy.
  - Has its own assets to trade.


Implementation Checkpoint 2:
+ Implemented trade pool mechanics in the simulated exchange.
  - Agents' assets are reserved whenever an order is placed.
  - This prevents agents from placing orders that they cannot afford.
+ Created time object for trading environment.
  - Unifies timing of the agents.
  - Size of time step can be specified.
+ Created the simulated trading environment (contains agents, trade exchanges, and a time object).
  - Includes agent generation method.
  - Runs the simulation for given number of timesteps.
+ Refactored trade strategy to its own class.
+ Started using python's built-in logging module to debug the simulation.
+ Added a momentum strategy
  - Has a band to allow deviation from average trading
  - Has a boolean input to allow anti-momentum traders

Implementation Checkpoint 3:
+ Implemented GetHistory method.
  - Get price candles of specified size (e.g. 1..n unit candles).
  - Get specified number of candles.
+ Added some unit tests for the Simulated Exchange.
  - Tests for order processing (buy/sell).
  - Tests for GetHistory method.
+ Added command-line arguments to simulator.
  - Number of trading agents.
  - Number of timesteps to simulate.

Implementation Checkpoint 4:
+ Added price history visualization.
+ Added wealth distribution visualization.
